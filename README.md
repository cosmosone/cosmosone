👋 Hi, I’m SJ @cosmosone

👀 I'm a solo developer creating apps and services to help people connect online using AI technology.

🌱 I'm currently learning advanced AI implementation techniques for exploring new frameworks for building more intuitive digital communication platforms and immersive virtual environments.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on innovative projects that bridge the gap between technology and human connection - particularly open-source initiatives focused on AI solutions, metaverse development, or community-building platforms.
